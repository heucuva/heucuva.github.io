This is a development blog for my personal projects and any work that I might do outside of my normal employer-sanctioned activities.

I talk about pretty much anything that catches my attention while I'm working on a project and it might seem like I'm bouncing around aimlessly at times.

My opinions are my own and do not reflect those that might be held by my employer - past or present - such as Activision Blizzard, Sony, Apple, or any others not explicitly named.
