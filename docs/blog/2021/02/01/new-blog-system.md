I've hooked in a new blog system based on mkdocs. The old Jekyll version was fine, but I wanted more of an automated notes/docs site on top of what Jekyll was giving out of the box.

I'm sure I could've made Jekyll do what I wanted with some effort and persistence, but I'm lazy when it comes to these sorts of things.
